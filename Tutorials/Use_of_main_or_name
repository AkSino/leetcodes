if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported into another module")


This basically means that if a python file is directly run then the __name__ will be set as __main__ otherwise if it is called
throuh some other module then it will not be set equal to __main__.


Also, if we import a module and in that module function is called, then it will also be called in the calling module. We dont want that.

Thats y we will use __name__. This will not let the entire code execute on import but on calling it
