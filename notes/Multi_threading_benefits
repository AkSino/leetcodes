Suppose there are two functions a and b.

We call function a but function a has to wait for some time due to some action requirement, for example user_input or there is a sleep
in that function, so for that time out CPU is sitting idle and doing nothing.

So in such a scenario multi-threading is useful.

As soon as a process becomes idle, it executes other process and then again come over the paused process.

To see it working, make two methods with a sleep in them and a print statement in both of them, and make them multi-threaded.
What we will observe is that both the method will be executed consecutively repeatedly.

This shows how multi threading saved time.
