print ("Vardan")

#This will simply print the Vardan when you import
#Create a new file named "Anything" and then import this file in init file. Now whenever somebody import your package, he will be
#redirected to this __init__.py file and directly import "Anything.py" file without any excess ovehead like following
from Module_example.anything import Vardan

# import Module_example.Anything.Class_name

#You have to use directly Module_example.Class_name
