If we want to know about the diagonal which is from top left to bottom right, just subtract row-column. Then all the cells with same
row-column will be the diagonal of that cell.

                                    11                              01
                                        22                              12
                                            33                              23
                                                44                               34

If we want to calculate diagonal from bottom left to top right to a particular cell, then sum the row and column of that cell, then
all the cell with same sum of row and column will be a diagonal.
